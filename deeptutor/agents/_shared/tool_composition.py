"""Per-turn tool composition policy shared by chat / quiz pipelines.

Owns the rule "given the user's composer toggles + the turn's context
flags, what tools should be enabled?". Lives outside any single pipeline
so chat and quiz can't disagree about which tools the user controls vs.
which the pipeline auto-mounts.

Two pieces:

* :data:`AUTO_MOUNTED_TOOLS` — tools whose mounting is owned by the
  pipeline (auto-on under specific conditions), not by user toggles.
  Membership here hides the tool from the user's composer / settings UI.
* :func:`compose_enabled_tools` — pure function that takes the user's
  toggled list + a :class:`ToolMountFlags` and returns the final, ordered
  enabled-tool list for one turn.

Callers resolve their own flags (chat checks selected KBs / source index
/ memory / notebooks; quiz reuses chat's policy verbatim).
